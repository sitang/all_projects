    "\n",
    "Yelp hypothesizes that this is, in fact, because different people tend to give their ratings based on different things. They believe that perhaps some people always base their ratings on quality of food, others on service, and perhaps other categories as well. \n",

    "1. Do some users tend to talk about service more than others in reviews/tips? Divide up the tips/reviews into more \"service-focused\" ones and those less concerned with service.\n",
    "2. Create two new ratings for businesses: ratings from just the service-focused reviews and ratings from the non-service reviews.\n",
    "3. Construct a regression model for each of the two ratings. They should use the same predictor variables (of your choice). \n",
    "4. Validate the performance of the models.\n",
    "5. Do the models coefficients differ at all? What does this tell you about the hypothesis that there are in fact two different kinds of ratings?"
